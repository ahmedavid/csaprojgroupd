32 bit single-cycle cpu were developed, that supports following instructions:
	1. Data processing instructions – ADD, AND, SUB, ORR (along with S for setting flags)
	2. Branch instruction – B
	3. Memory instructions – LDR, STR
According to the requirements, LDR instruction does not support pre-index and post-index modes. For the same reasons, Data processing instructions, does not support logical or arithmetic shifts which can be part of these instructions.

To execute the tests which are included in the project deliverable, follow these steps:
	1. Open the single_cycle_cpu.circ through Logisim
	2. Right click on the ROM
	3. Select Edit Contents. As a result Hex Edior window should be visible
	4. In the Hex Editor window press "open" button
	5. Select the test that needs to be executed
	6. Close the Hex Editor window
	7. In Logisim press the Simulate dropdown and in the dropdown press the Ticks Enabled button
